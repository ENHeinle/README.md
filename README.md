### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emma!

Iâ€™m currently expanding my programming skills, with a primary focus on **Python**. I have a background in **Conservation and Environmental Biology**, but Iâ€™m diving into programming to enhance my abilities in the workplace. As I continue to learn and grow, Iâ€™ll be sharing my projects here, showcasing my journey in automating processes, data analysis, and problem-solving.

Feel free to check out my repositories as I document my progress and contribute to various initiatives. Letâ€™s connect and learn together!
